# InstaJS #

### I'm not working on this anymore. I've moved to (nraboy/ng-cordova-oauth)[https://github.com/nraboy/ng-cordova-oauth] since I'm using Angular in my hybrid apps.

This was a working prototype. You'll need to figure out how to run it.

InstaJS is a micro-library that lets you integrate your JavaScript application with Instagram. 
InstaJS works for both BROWSER-BASED apps and CORDOVA/PHONEGAP apps.
This library has no dependency. You don't need jQuery or anything else.
InstaJS allows you to login to Instagram and execute any (right now, only GET requests works properly) Instagram API request.
 

Most of this code is from (Christophe Coenraets's OpenFB project)[https://github.com/ccoenraets/OpenFB].
